Cross Compilation environment
*****************************
Using Linux, it's possible to generate binaries for Windows.
Two cross-compiler toolchains are available under Fedora and CentOS 7 to create binaries for Windows 32 and 64 bits.
All packages needed are available at

 * Windows cygwin target: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/grenier/cygwin-testdisk/
 * Windows mingw target: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/grenier/mingw-testdisk/

testdisk, photorec and fidentify official binaries are generated using cygwin,
qphotorec using mingw.
